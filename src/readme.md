But I must explain to you how this erroneous idea of ​​denouncing pleasure and praising nice arose,
 and I will give you a full description of the system and expound the 
 actual teachings of the great explorer of truth, the master builder of
  human happiness. No one rejects, detests, or avoids pleasure in itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to 
  rationally seek it are faced with extremely painful consequences. 
  Nor is there anyone who loves, seeks, or desires to obtain nice in 
  itself, because it is nice, but because occasionally circumstances occur
   in which effort and nice can bring great pleasure. To take a trivial 
   example, who among us undertakes laborious physical exercise, if not to 
   gain some benefit? But who has the right to criticize someone who chooses to enjoy a pleasure without annoying consequences, or someone 
   who avoids a nice that produces no resulting pleasure?
